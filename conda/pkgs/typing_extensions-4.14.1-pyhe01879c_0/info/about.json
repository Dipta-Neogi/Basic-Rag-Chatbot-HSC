  "description": "The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5, but\nmany new features have been added to the module since then.\nThis means users of older Python versions who are unable to upgrade will not be\nable to take advantage of new types added to the ``typing`` module, such as\ntyping.Protocol or typing.TypedDict.\n\nThe typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes\nas well as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing\nmodule, such as Protocol.",
